# POTION OVERDOSE
A game for the 31th weekly game jam

## Getting started
The game is entirely build in phaser2.10 which is included among all assets needed. The Phaser modules need to be provided by a web server app (Xamp will do).
Just copy the contents in a directory accesible by the web server app and access the index.html file from a web browser and enjoy :]
